    <h1>Markov models for epidemics</h1>

    <h2>Epidemic Markov model</h2>
          <p> Consider a network $\mathcal{G}$ of $N$ individuals subject to an epidemic disease.
            Let $A$ the adjacency matrix of the underlying graph $\mathcal{G}$ and $X_i(t)$ be the
            health state of individual $i$ at time $t$.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically $X_i$ does not define a stationary Markov process because its transition rates are often assumed
            to be dependent on the other nodes $X_j(t) for j \neq i$. However one can define the <b>configuration process</b>
            $\mathbb{X}(t)\in \{\text{susceptible}, \text{infected}\}^N$ and view the epidemic as a random walk in the space of the $2^N$ possible
            configurations of healty/infected nodes. This formulation is mostly for theoretical purpose, in practice
            the process is much easier to describe and simulate at the node level.
          </p>

        <h2>Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS)</h2>
        <p> In the SIS model, one assumes the following stochastic evolution:
          $$
          X_i(t) : \begin{cases}
                \text{susceptible} \rightarrow \text{infected} & \text{at rate $\beta\sum_j A_{ij} \mathbb{1}_{X_j(t) = \text{infected}}$,} \\
                \text{infected} \rightarrow \text{susceptible} & \text{at rate $\delta$.} \\
             \end{cases}
          $$
          In other words, the total infection rate of an individual is proportional to the number of infected neighbors in
          the network, each of them adding an extra $\beta$, and the recovery rate $\delta$ is constant (individuals do not recover faster if they are surrounded by
          more healthy neighbors).
        </p>
        <p>
          We also assume only one individual can change state at a given time $t$ (the events of multiple simultaneous transitions have probability zero anyway).

          Note that in this model. $X_i(t)$ has no memory of its previous health states (Markov property). Consequently, it models situations where individuals can
          be infected multiples times without developping immunity.
        </p>

        <h2>Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)</h2>
        <p>
          In the SIR model, one assumes the same stochastic evolution with an extra state for recovered individuals, i.e previously infected but now immune.
          The epidemic dynamic now becomes:
          $$
          X_i(t) : \begin{cases}
                \text{susceptible} \rightarrow \text{infected} & \text{at rate $\beta \sum_j A_{ij} \mathbb{1}_{X_j(t) = \text{infected}}$,} \\
                \text{infected} \rightarrow \text{recovered} & \text{at rate $\delta$.} \\
             \end{cases}
          $$
          In other words, the infection rate for an individual is knocked out to zero if he or she has been infected in the past. The configuration process remains
          Markovian but is now defined on a bigger state space with $3^N$ configurations to account for the extra state.
        </p>

        <h2>Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)</h2>
        <p>
          In the SEIR model, one assumes the same stochastic evolution as SIR with an extra state to represent incubation time during which individuals are not contagious
          but are bound to become infected.
          The epidemic dynamic is now:
          $$
          X_i(t) : \begin{cases}
                \text{susceptible} \rightarrow \text{exposed} & \text{at rate $\beta \sum_j A_{ij} \mathbb{1}_{X_j(t) = \text{infected}}$,} \\
                \text{exposed} \rightarrow \text{infected} & \text{at rate $\gamma$,} \\
                \text{infected} \rightarrow \text{recovered} & \text{at rate $\delta$.} \\
             \end{cases}
          $$
        </p>

        <h2>Epidemic lifetime</h2>
        <p>
          The configuration process $\mathbb{X}$ is an irreducible Markov process on a large yet finite state space with an absorbing state (the configuration where no individual is ill).
          It is therefore guaranteed that the process will eventually converge to this absorbing state. The question that remains is how fast this convergence occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>effective diffusion rate</b> is defined as $\rho = \frac{\beta}{\delta}$. The duration and strength of the epidemic depends on this effective diffusion rate but
          also on the topology of the underlying social network. Intuitively, the more connected the network, the easier for the disease to spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          A result in  <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~maajg/infocom-worm.pdf">The Effect of Network Topology on the Spread of Epidemics</a>
          shows that the inverse of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix $\rho(A) = \max_{\lambda\in Spec(A)}|\lambda|$ is a threshold for a phase transition in
          the epidemic behaviour of the SIS model (the same threshold applies for SIR too). In addition for the SIS model, a sufficient condition for an exponentially
          long epidemic lifetime involves the isoperimetric constant (also known as Cheeger's constant) $\eta(\mathcal{G})$ of the underlying network. Note that this
          constant is combinatorially hard to compute but can estimated using the adjacency spectral gap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let $T_{extinction}$ the stopping time of the epidemic. Then:
          <ul>
          <li> if $\rho < \frac{1}{\rho(A)}$, then $\mathbb{E}[T_{extinction}] = \mathcal{O}\big( \log N\big)$</li>
          <li> if $\rho > \frac{1}{\eta(\mathcal{G})}$, then $\mathbb{E}[T_{extinction}] = \Omega\big( e^{N^\alpha}\big)$, where $\alpha>0$ is a constant.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
